# Exploring_Crypto_Market

This project analyzes cryptocurrency market data to visualize market capitalization and volatility. The data is sourced from CoinMarketCap and processed using pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to:

1. Visualize the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
2. Analyze the volatility of cryptocurrencies over 24-hour and 7-day intervals.
3. Categorize cryptocurrencies based on their market capitalization.

## Steps

- Filter out rows without market capitalization data.


2. Market Capitalization Analysis:
